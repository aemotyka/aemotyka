# About Me
AI Engineer at M.S. Rau with an MS in Computer Science from Tulane. I love the nuts and bolts of CSâ€” computer architecture, low-level systems, and how they connect to ML. Long-term, Iâ€™m aiming toward a PhD and hope to work on specialized hardware for ML, or software that powers space exploration.
